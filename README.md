# myhttp

Just a small CLI-tool I've built in Rust, for hosting a folder locally over HTTP.

Based on the code from the webserver you build at end of the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book)-book.

Not available for installation anywhere since there are way better alternatives out there.
